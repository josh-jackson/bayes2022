<h2>Homework protocol</h2>
<p>Each will be turned in via email to josh at <a href="mailto:j.jackson@wustl.edu" class="email">j.jackson@wustl.edu</a> . For each homework you will need to attach to the email 1) an rmd or a rnw file of your code and answers and 2) a pdf of said file. Use your last name to label the files (e.g,. “Jackson_HW1”) and include your name as part of the document front-/top-matter/YAML.</p>
<p>You may work together on each of these homeworks as long as everyone turns in a separate file and understand EACH LINE OF CODE. If you do not understand then ask during class.</p>
