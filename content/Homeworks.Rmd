## Homework protocol

Each will be turned in via email to josh at j.jackson@wustl.edu . For each homework will need to attach to the email 1) an rmd or a rnw file of your code and answers and 2) a pdf of said file. Use your last name to label the files (e.g,. “Jackson_HW1”) and include your name as part of the document front-/top-matter/YAML.

You may work together on each of these homeworks as long as everyone turns in a separate file and understand EACH LINE OF CODE. If you do not understand then ask during class.
