<h4>Course Description</h4>
<p>Bayesian parameter estimation and hypothesis testing offer a useful alternative to the classic frequentist paradigm within psychological science. This class will cover the foundations of Bayesian inference and hypothesis testing with the primary emphasis on fitting multiple regression and multi-level models common within psychology. A variety of response distributions will be discussed: Gaussian, binary and count, ordinal, survival, probability, and zero-inflated models, among others. Topics include: model calibration, regularization, prior and posterior predictions, Bayes factors, missing data, Bayesian power, cross-validation, Bayesian meta-analysis, distributional models, and multivariate response models.</p>

<h4>Class textbook</h4>
<p>-McElreath, R. (2020). Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R. SECOND EDITION CRC Press.</p>
<p>Note that McElreath also has lectures from his book posted on his youtube. They are excellent. While some bits of the materialcovered in class are covered in his lectures I believe the content of this course and his course compliment one another. His focus is making the content digestible, viewing the broader picture, and delving into philosophy of science more so. We will focus more on the applied aspects, using specific programs and making sure we are comfortable “doing” the work rather than just understanding it at the high level.</p>

<div id="grading" class="section level4">
<h4>Grading</h4>
<p>Grades consist of two components: weekly homework and a takehome project. Each will count for half of your grade.</p>
<p>Weekly homework consists of thought questions, as well as computations. Homework may be worked on together in groups. However, short answer portions should be in your own words. Each homework is graded on a scale of 1-10.</p>
<p>You will also have random “quizzes,” which are not graded but are submitted. These serves as progress checks for both me and you.</p>
<p>The takehome project is a series of models and visualizations using your own data. We (you and Josh) will work together to go over what your data are, and what sort of analyses, checks and visualizations you should do. The sooner in the semester you have these conversations with me, the better. By week 6 you need to have a plan approved by me.</p>

<h4>Class procedure</h4>
<p>The class will be a mix of in person and recorded lectures. Synchronous and Asynchronous are the latest buzz words. The mix will hopefully be beneficial. On one hand, you can be more flexible with your schedule – something that everyone needs during these times. On the other hand, having in person sessions facilitates discussion and QnA, an important component of learning the material. The exact breakdown will differ from week to week. However, after the first week, we will likely have Thursday’s be the day that will minimize in-person contact. Thursday instead will be for viewing lectures and for doing the weekly homework.</p>
